# Full Stack Deep Learning Spring 2021 Labs

Welcome!

As part of Full Stack Deep Learning 2021, we will incrementally develop a complete deep learning codebase to understand the content of handwritten paragraphs.

We will use the modern stack of PyTorch and PyTorch-Lightning

We will use the main workhorses of DL today: CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers

We will manage our experiments using what we believe to be the best tool for the job: Weights & Biases

We will set up continuous integration system for our codebase using CircleCI

We will package up the prediction system as a REST API using FastAPI, and deploy it as a Docker container on AWS Lambda.

We will set up monitoring that alerts us when the incoming data distribution changes.

Sequence:

- [Lab Setup](setup/readme.md): Set up our computing environment.
- [Lab 1: Intro](lab1/readme.md): Formulate problem, structure codebase, train an MLP for MNIST.
- [Lab 2: CNNs](lab2/readme.md): Introduce EMNIST, generate synthetic handwritten lines, and train CNNs.
- [Lab 3: RNNs](lab3/readme.md): Using CNN + LSTM with CTC loss for line text recognition.
- [Lab 4: Transformers](lab4/readme.md): Using Transformers for line text recognition.
- [Lab 5: Experiment Management](lab5/readme.md): Real handwriting data, Weights & Biases, and hyperparameter sweeps.
- [Lab 6: Data Labeling](lab6/readme.md): Label our own handwriting data and properly store it.
- [Lab 7: Paragraph Recognition](lab7/readme.md): Train and evaluate whole-paragraph recognition.
- [Lab 8: Continuous Integration](lab8/readme.md): Add continuous linting and testing of our code.
- [Lab 9: Deployment](lab9/readme.md): Run as a REST API locally, then in Docker, then put in production using AWS Lambda.
- [Lab 10: Monitoring](lab10/readme.md): Set up monitoring that alerts us when the incoming data distribution changes.
